#Hieranarchy

#What is it?

Hieranarchy is the name of the game I made for LD 29 that inspired me to make this engine. That was the original aim of the engine, to be used to rewrite the game, but it has become more of a tool for me to learn how to write a game engine.

#How does it work?

It has multiple systems that can be utilised to make a game. The list is outlined below.

#What is left to do?

Currently, a lot.

Features:
- Map and State system which allows to dynamically load and swap states and maps
- Dynamic tile system which allows you to create and save different tiles
- Project system which saves and loads maps
- Basic UI system
- Task Scheduling based on updates
- Events
- Basic Controller input support
- Key bindings

What is left to come is:
- Better control over map and project data
- Entities as a whole
- Rewrite of the graphics to use newer technology
- and whatever anyone else wants to suggest!

#Can I test it?

Sure anyone can download the source and build it themselves, however you would need to download GSON and LWJGL 3 and then add them to the build path etc. So I have added a build folder that has the runnable jar that will be updated fairly often. All you need to do to run this is to download the jar and the assets folder, have them in the same application, and then run the jar and it works :D
